## Additional Notes

1. There is no backend for this app, so save your important data on your own.
2. I can't write code, this app is entirely written by the AI, mainly for my personal requirment. If you have a new feature or meet a bug, I can only try to do it, but I can't guarantee it, because it depends on the AI to do it successfully.üòπ
